## 🎯 The Problem

Most AI assistants are one brain trying to do everything — scheduling, emailing, task tracking, note-taking — with no real specialization. NEXUS takes a different approach: instead of one generalist, it's a team of specialists that automatically figures out who should handle each request.

## ⚡ What It Does

NEXUS routes every user request through an AI-powered router that decides which of its four specialized agents should respond — then hands off the request and returns a focused, role-appropriate answer.

Type a request in plain English. NEXUS figures out whether it's a calendar task, an email draft, a to-do priority call, or a note to save — and responds accordingly.

## 🧠 The Agents

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| 📅 **Calendar Agent** | Manages schedules, appointments, and reminders |
| ✉️ **Email Agent** | Drafts, organizes, and helps manage email communication |
| ✅ **Task Agent** | Coordinates to-do items, priorities, and deadlines |
| 🗒️ **Notes Agent** | Saves and retrieves notes — with real persistent storage |

## 🛠️ How It's Built
User Input → AI Router (classifies intent) → Specialized Agent → Response
↓
Notes Agent → Persistent JSON storage

**Routing:** Instead of hardcoded keyword rules, NEXUS asks the LLM itself to classify each request and pick the right agent — genuine agent-to-agent coordination logic, not a simple if/else chain.

**Persistence:** Unlike a typical chatbot demo, the Notes Agent actually writes to disk. Notes survive across sessions and can be retrieved on demand.

**Two interfaces:**
- A **terminal version** (`main.py`) with a colored CLI, originally built to run fully locally using Ollama with Llama 3.2 (3B) — no external API, no internet dependency.
- A **deployed web version** (`app.py`) built with Streamlit, using Groq's cloud API (Llama 3.1 8B) for inference so it can run as a live, publicly accessible demo.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

`Python` · `Groq API` · `Llama 3.1 (8B)` · `Streamlit` · `Ollama` (local mode) · `Colorama` · `Requests` · `JSON`

## 🚀 Run It Yourself

**Option 1 — Terminal version (local, free, using Ollama):**

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama and pull the model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# 2. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AkshayEtukuri/NEXUS-Multi-Agent-AI.git
cd NEXUS-Multi-Agent-AI

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install requests colorama

# 4. Run NEXUS
python main.py
```

**Option 2 — Web version (using Groq API):**

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key from console.groq.com
# 2. Set it as an environment variable
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install groq streamlit

# 4. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```
